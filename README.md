# Basic-Pentesting-Scripts
A repository of some python scripts I wrote for penetration testing purposes. Feel free to use or modify these for your own needs :D

****

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts designed for network scanning, brute-force login attempts, SSH authentication testing, and password hash cracking. 

## Tools Overview

### 1. Port Scanner
A multi-threaded port scanner that detects open ports on a target machine and attempts to identify the services running on those ports.

- **File**: `scanner.py`
- **Description**: Scans a range of ports on the target IP address and identifies open ports and services.
- **Usage**:
  ```bash
  python3 port_scanner.py <target IP> <start port> <end port>
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  python3 scanner.py 192.168.1.1 50 85
  ```

### 2. Brute Force Login Script
A script that performs brute-force attacks on a login form by trying different username and password combinations.

- **File**: `loginformforce.py`
- **Description**: Attempts to login to a web service by iterating over lists of usernames and passwords.
- **Usage**:
  ```bash
  python3 loginformforce.py <target URL> <failure indicator> <username list> <password list>
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  python3 loginformforce.py http://example.com/login "Invalid login" usernames.txt passwords.txt
  ```

### 3. SSH Brute Force Script
A script that attempts to brute-force SSH credentials using a list of usernames and passwords.

- **File**: `newsshbruteforce.py`
- **Description**: Tries to connect to an SSH server using combinations of usernames and passwords.
- **Usage**:
  ```bash
  python3 newsshbruteforce.py <target IP> <username list> <password list>
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  python3 newsshbruteforce.py 192.168.1.1 usernames.txt passwords.txt
  ```

### 4. Hash Cracking Script
A script that attempts to crack a given hash by comparing it with the hashes of passwords from a wordlist.

- **File**: `cracker.py`
- **Description**: Attempts to crack MD5, SHA1, or SHA256 hashes using a wordlist.
- **Usage**:
  ```bash
  python3 cracker.py <hash option> <hash> <wordlist>
  ```
- **Hash Options**:
  - `-m` : MD5
  - `-s` : SHA256
  - `-d` : SHA1
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  python3 hash_cracker.py -m d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e wordlist.txt
  ```
